title: Zelda - Hestu maracas/music
author: Lidi
description: This is a small embedded systems project I made using Arduino. It plays Hestuâ€™s maracas music from The Legend of Zelda and uses a sound sensor to trigger red LEDs inside handmade maracas, just like in the game. Everything is built into a box, with a custom Hestu figure I sculpted in polymer clay.
